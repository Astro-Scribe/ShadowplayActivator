# INSTRUCTIONS:
Download the shadowplay_activator.exe file above, place it wherever you want on your computer for safekeeping, then run it once (this will add it to your startup programs)
Make sure to set your hotkey/shortcut to "Toggle Instant Replay On/Off" is set to "Shift+Alt+F10"
(This is under Settings -> Shortcuts -> Subheading 'Record' ~ little over halfway down the screen in the newish Nvidia overlay menu thing)

Voila!
About 30 seconds after you start your computer and login, the program will check to see if Shadowplay is already on - if it isn't, then it'll simulate the hotkey/shortcut entry for you.
