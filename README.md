### Download the shadowplay_activator.exe file above
(Click the green '<> Code' button above, then 'Download ZIP', then extract the files - you can delete everything except the exe of course)
### Place it wherever you want on your computer for safekeeping
### Run it once (this will add it to your startup programs)

# Make sure your hotkey/shortcut to "Toggle Instant Replay On/Off" is set to "Alt+Shift+F10"
(This is under Settings -> Shortcuts -> Subheading 'Record' ~ little over halfway down the screen in the newish Nvidia overlay menu thing)

Done!
From now on, about 30 seconds after you start your computer and login, the program will check to see if Shadowplay is already on - if it isn't, then it'll simulate the hotkey/shortcut entry for you.

## Further Info
This script is designed only to ensure that 'Instant Replay' (aka 'Shadowplay') is turned on just after your computer launches. It will not turn it back on if it is turned off by other programs like Netflix or other streaming platforms etc.
It only works on Windows PCs with Nvidia App installed and running the overlay, with your hotkey/shortcut for activating Instant Replay set to 'Alt+Shift+F10'.
Each time you move the program to a new location, ensure you run it manually once so it may add its new location to the startup programs for windows to run.
